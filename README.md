# **Water Usage and Conservation Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes global water consumption patterns and trends using data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. The goal is to provide actionable insights for stakeholders, such as policymakers and environmentalists, to optimize water usage and promote conservation. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, predictive modeling, and anomaly detection.

## **Features**
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed raw data to handle missing values and ensure numeric consistency.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created derived metrics like *Yearly Water Used Per Capita* and *Daily Water Usage Percentage* for deeper insights.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Heatmap of top 20 countries by yearly water usage.
  - Correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.
  - Pair plots, histograms, and boxplots for distribution and outlier detection.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Built and compared **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models.
  - Evaluated models using metrics such as MSE and \( R^2 \).
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identified unusual data points using residual analysis.

## **Key Results**
1. **Top Water-Consuming Countries**: Identified countries with the highest average yearly water usage.
2. **Model Performance**:
   - Linear Regression: \( R^2 \) = 0.81, MSE = 1.94e+20
   - Random Forest: \( R^2 \) = 0.70, MSE = 3.03e+20
3. **Anomalies**: Detected and visualized data points with unusual water usage patterns.
